## Contributing

* If you're unsure if a feature would make a good addition, you can always [create an issue](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer/issues/new) first. Raising an issue before creating a pull request is recommended. 
* We aim for 100% test coverage. Please write tests for any new functionality or changes.
* Any API changes should be fully documented.
* Make sure your code meets our linting standards. Run `npm run lint` to check your code.
* Maintain the existing coding style. There are some settings in `.jsbeautifyrc` to help.
* Be mindful of others when making suggestions and/or code reviewing.
